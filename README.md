# Database Engine Prototype

## Overview
This project delivers a lightweight, high-performance database engine engineered to support core relational operations and advanced multi-dimensional indexing. Built in Java, it demonstrates proficiency in low-level data management, efficient storage strategies, and query acceleration techniques—key skills for data science infrastructure development.

## Key Capabilities

- **Relational Data Management**  
  • Define tables with flexible schemas (Integer, String, Double, Date)  
  • Perform robust CRUD workflows (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- **Multi-Dimensional Indexing**  
  • Accelerate complex queries via Octree indices  
  • Support three-dimensional data searches with minimal latency  
- **Optimized Storage Architecture**  
  • Serialized page files on disk for persistent, thread-safe access  
  • Lazy loading of pages to conserve memory footprint  

## Technical Highlights

- **Language & Frameworks**  
  • Java-based core logic and serialization for persistence  
  • CSV-driven metadata store for table definitions, constraints, and index configurations  
- **Index Structure**  
  • Custom Octree implementation enabling efficient range queries over multi-attribute datasets  
- **Performance Considerations**  
  • Vector-backed I/O for concurrent read/write safety  
  • On-demand page loading reducing in-memory overhead  

## Motivation & Impact
Developed as part of an advanced systems curriculum, this engine equips engineers with:

- Hands-on experience in database internals and data structure design  
- Deep understanding of indexing mechanisms and their impact on query performance  
- Expertise in balancing persistence, concurrency, and resource consumption  

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/database-application-project.git
   cd database-application-project
````

2. **Compile the code**

   ```bash
   javac -cp ".:libs/*" src/main/java/com/yourorg/dbapp/*.java
   ```
3. **Execute the engine**

   ```bash
   java -cp ".:libs/*:src/main/java" com.yourorg.dbapp.DBApp
   ```

## Usage

1. **Initialize** a new database and define table schemas with the provided console interface.
2. **Insert** and **query** data through straightforward API calls or command-line prompts.
3. **Create** Octree indices on up to three columns to optimize high-dimensional queries.
4. **Monitor** performance metrics and adjust paging strategy as needed.

## Contributing

Interested in extending functionality or improving performance? We welcome:

* New indexing techniques (e.g., R-trees, LSM-trees)
* Enhanced transaction support and concurrency control
* Integration with external query optimizers
